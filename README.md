# flexer-unicode-regular-expressions
A python script built for generating flexer-compatible regular expressions to capture all the unicode code points in specific general categories


## How it Works
1. The script will automatically parse through every code point found in the all_unicode_chars.txt file and find each code points' general category.
2. After some processing, the script will place the desired code points (based on the conditional statements in **lines 50-56**.
3. Then, the script will generate a flexer-compatible regular expression, based on line length and delimination strings.

## To use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Cusomtize the conditional statements in **lines 50-56** to include the general categories you want to generate the regular expressions you need.
3. Edit the end of the script to print the expressions generated by using the `make_hex_string()` function.
4. Run the script with `python unicode.py`.
